Currently, this generates lil wav files of the beats in the excellant [Pocket Operations](https://shittyrecording.studio/) and lets user select and see/play them.

I think I would like to pre-render all the beats as midi files, for maximum reuse, though:

- [html-midi-player](https://github.com/cifkao/html-midi-player) for display/play
- [jsmidgen](https://github.com/dingram/jsmidgen) for generating midi files
